In my mind the two biggest considerations for ORC over Parquet are:

1. Many of the performance improvements provided in the Stinger initiative are dependent on features of the ORC 
   format including block level index for each column. This leads to potentially more efficient I/O allowing Hive 
   to skip reading entire blocks of data if it determines predicate values are not present there. Also the 
   Cost Based Optimizer has the ability to consider column level metadata present in ORC files in order to generate 
   the most efficient graph.

2. ACID transactions are only possible when using ORC as the file format.
